Coded Gamer is an open source Ruby on Rails CMS project for the site CodedGamer.com.

Our goal is to build the future platform of Coded Gamer through open source community builds, with each person contributing a bit here and there as they have time. 

=================
      CODE STYLEGUIDES
=================

Our styleguides are simple and if you have ever worked on a ruby or rails project before you probably already know them. 
We follow the best practices of Ruby and Rails as laid out by Bozhidar Batsov (http://batsov.com).
These are the same best practices and styleguides used in hundreds of projects, including github itself.

Ruby: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide

Rails: https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide

If you intend to contribute to this project you MUST code by these style guides or your project will be rejected until corrected.
This is to help streamline the process and also ensures the final code will be easy to read and function properly.

 HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT
=================

This project is community driven. The main needs and wants will be laid out below but it will depend on you. 

"Current features" is a rundown of, you guessed it, the current features and what has been accomplished so far (with credits to the respected contributors whenever possible).

"Critical" are items that need to be addressed ASAP to keep the project and website functioning properly. 

"Next step" is the best place to start contributing. These are literally the next steps in the project.

"Low Priority" comes after the next step. Working on them will greatly speed up the project. 
As the next step is completed the next most critical code will be chosen from low priority and moved to next step. 

"Desired long term features" lists our long term goals. Look at it as an outline of things to come soon. This list will grow as the project grows.
